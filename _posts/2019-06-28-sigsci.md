Cybrary chose to replace their legacy WAF with Signal Sciences for the ease of use, performance, and availability of features and integrations required by the infrastructure team.

“We deployed Signal Sciences behind our current WAF, and over one weekend we saw it block attacks our WAF was missing. The dashboards allowed us to easily see and track malicious activity in a way we couldn’t with our old WAF.”

—Jonathan Meyers, Principal Infrastructure Engineer at Cybrary
