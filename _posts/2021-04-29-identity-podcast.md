DevSecOps: what does it REALLY mean?

This week, host Cameron D’Ambrosi welcomes Mike Gruen, CISO & VP of Engineering, and Jonathan Meyers, Head of IT and Principal Infrastructure Engineer at Cybrary. They’ll discuss the risk reduction and security improvement of passwordless identity verification. Gruen and Meyers explain why DevSecOps should focus on breaking down silos and applying software engineering best practices to both security and operations.
