In this Episode of the Cybrary Podcast, tech startup Xmode reveals their early hurdles and mistakes in understanding the hidden value and risks behind location data collection. Joined by Xmode CEO Josh Anton and Mary Souther, Head of Cybersecurity Sales, Cybrary's Mike Gruen and Jonathan Meyers go back to 2008 in their discussion about Blackberry, Bluetooth technology, and Apple conspiracies. It's all in the name of smart device evolution! 
Plus, hear the backstory of Xmode (previously DrunkMode) and what the precipice was for them to pivot from a safety solution for college students, to being "a living map for your life."
