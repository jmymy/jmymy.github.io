The 401 Access Denied team discusses the latest findings from the recent Sunburst supply chain attack that targeted thousands of SolarWinds customers – quite possibly the largest supply chain attack in history. We cover what’s been learned from the investigation so far and how we can apply those lessons to prevent being victims of future attacks. Joe and Mike are joined by Terence Jackson, CISO at Thycotic and Jonathan Meyers, Principal Infrastructure Engineer and Head of IT at Cybrary.
