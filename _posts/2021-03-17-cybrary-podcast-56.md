On this episode of the Cybrary Podcast, we welcome back Base Operations, introducing Scott Money, the VP of Engineering. Everyone knows Google, but Mike, Jonathan, and Scott throwback to the days of Lycos, before PHP, server side scripting, cookies, and SSL. What launched Google into becoming the leading name in search engines around the world, and what advancements were pivotal in the success and failures of companies since the 1990â€™s? Scott dives into the role Base Operations plays in data gathering, and how people and companies today can benefit from and are impacted by the wealth of information on the internet.
